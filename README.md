# EpidemiumOpenCancer's Graphical-User-Interface 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.8.

## Compatibility
Better use Microsoft Edge. 
You will have sharp country edges... You will not see the whole world map, this will teach first time users to use the country list menu. 
With Chrome, updating incidence and country color several times will make the map disapear if zoom factor is over 33%. 
And Contries edges will be aliased, for "performance optimisation" reasons .
Don't use Firefox for now, Events are not fired correctly yet 
;-)
Best debbuging experience using Chrome.
